# Ray-Tracer
A simple yet elegant ray tracer that renders a complex three dimensional scene with raw light data and shading utilizing only C++ and 2D drawing techniques.
Supports lambertian shading and multiple light sources.
Note this is a very CPU intensive program and may take several minutes to render depending on scene complexity.
